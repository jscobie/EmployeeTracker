## Description

This project's challenge  was built to show my continued learning in Full Stack web development. This project I have learned and will be using SQL and MySQL to populate values into a database and retrieve them through HTTP requests using an Express Server. This Employee Tracker is not a website but a command line interface to manage an employee database using Node.js, select NPM packages (Inquirer, MySQL2, and Console.table), and a MySQL database.
